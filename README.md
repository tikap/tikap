  TikApps

<p>
  A web app project that has various tools for daily use. For example, it can calculate BMI and daily calorie requirements.
This was mainly an experimental project to explore cross-device UI / UX using Next JS, React, Tailwind CSS and Vercel. It was fun diving into server / client side rendering for web apps.
Feel free to visit and use the tool: https://tika.vercel.app/
