Welcome to my GitHub! I am Tika, a computer engineer with a career in software development. 

Most of my repos are private so you will not see all of them listed. 

My public projects:

- TikApps  
  
Concept web app project that has various tools for your health. It can calculate your BMI and daily calorie requirements.
This was mainly an experimental project to explore Next JS, React and Vercel from the ground up. It was fun diving into server / client side rendering for web apps.
Feel free to visit and use the tool: [tika.vercel.app](tika.vercel.app)

- tikap.github.io  
  
A portfolio site, similar to above, meant to explore new technologies.
This project focuses on front end development using the trifecta of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.
