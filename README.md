  I am Tika, a computer engineering graduate with a career in software development and IT. 
Almost all my repositories are private as they were made for experimental development and exploration of technologies. They will be made public in the future as development concludes.
</p>

To date, there are two public projects listed below: 

<h2>
  TikApps
</h2>
<p>
  A web app project that has various tools for your health. It can calculate BMI and daily calorie requirements.
This was mainly an experimental project to explore Next JS, React, Tailwind CSS and Vercel. It was fun diving into server / client side rendering for web apps.
Feel free to visit and use the tool: [tika.vercel.app/](https://tika.vercel.app/)
</p>

<h2>
  tikap.github.io
</h2>
<p>
A portfolio site meant to explore github pages and its deployment as a static site.
This project is solely front end development using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.
