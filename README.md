Welcome to my GitHub! I am Tika, a computer engineering graduate with a career in software development and IT. 

Most of my repos are private as they were made for experimental development and exploration of technologies.
My public projects:

- TikApps  
  
Concept web app project that has various tools for your health. It can calculate your BMI and daily calorie requirements.
This was mainly an experimental project to explore Next JS, React, Tailwind CSS and Vercel. It was fun diving into server / client side rendering for web apps.
Feel free to visit and use the tool: [tika.vercel.app/](https://tika.vercel.app/)

- tikap.github.io  
  
A portfolio site, similar to above, meant to explore new technologies.
This project focuses on front end development using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and JavaScript.
